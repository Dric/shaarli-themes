# Themes for Shaarli
This is a collection of themes and stylesheets for use with [Shaarli](https://github.com/sebsauvage/Shaarli).
Feel free to fork this repository, add your themes under the `themes/yourthemename` directory (prefereably with some screenshots **and a proper free software license text** and send a pull request to have your theme added to the repo.
Eventually when we have enough quality themes, we will submit this for upstream integration.

Happy hacking!
